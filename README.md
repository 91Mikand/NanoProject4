# Project Motivation:
This is a part of the Udacity Data Science NanoDegree. 
The task at hand was to use the datasets provided by Starbucks to find some insights into the appeal of their promotional offers. 
I tried to figure out which offers are the most attractive for the customers by analyzing the data.
There are several types of promo offers available for Starbucks clients. With the help of the provided data, we need to find out which type of offer is the most appealing and which customer group is more likely to profit from the promotional offers. 
We need to find out the relations between customers’ characteristics (age, gender, income, etc) and their willingness to take advantage of the offer.


<a id='File Descriptions'></a>
# File Descriptions:
For this project, I had three available datasets in a form of .json files:
- portfolio.json
- profile.json
- transcript.json
Portfolio.json contains the data about the offers — their types, duration, etc.
Profile.json contains information about the users — their gender, age, income and the time when they became the member.
Transcript.json is basically a log of transaction and offer completions. Unfortunately this file is too big to upload it on github, therefore I uploaded it to WeTransfer: https://we.tl/t-1rvf9FhQtq
Please download the file and put it in the data folder before running my code.
